Snipverse — Web3 Immune System
Official Design, Documentation & Security Specification

Overview
The Snipverse Web3 Immune System is a next-generation, zero-trust defensive architecture for Web3 ecosystems — engineered to detect threats, enforce behavioural constraints, and neutralise malicious actors before critical failure occurs.

This repository contains:
	•	The full technical specification
	•	Institutional hardening frameworks
	•	Governance models
	•	Threat detection logic
	•	Complete defensive blueprint authored by Edward “N.E.O.” Vaughan

This system is released publicly as an open security standard, but remains authored intellectual property with strict attribution requirements under the provided LICENSE.

Purpose
The Snipverse Web3 Immune System solves three core problems:
	1.	Web3 remains vulnerable to behavioural attacks
Sybil behaviour, honeypots, bot-driven fraud, liquidity ambushes, high-velocity manipulation, orchestrated exploits.
	2.	Centralised authority cannot be trusted
The system is designed so no single developer, team, or multisig group can hijack, corrupt, or weaponise the network.
	3.	Communities deserve self-defence
This framework enables communities to observe threats, flag malicious actors, and apply collective immune responses.

Core Components

A. Detection Layer
Behavioural heuristics and pattern analysis including exploit signatures, coordinated activity detection, wallet clustering, contract event anomalies, token velocity irregularities, and honeypot formation triggers.

B. Immune Response Layer
Governance-driven and automated responses including rate-limiting, blacklisting, circuit breakers, contract pausing mechanisms, community-ratified escalation, and evidence-based intervention models.

C. Governance Layer
Immutable public audit trails, behaviour-based governance, multi-phase escalation, identity-agnostic voting, and distributed decision flows that prevent capture.

Institutional & Hardening Strategy
The Institutional & Hardening Framework provides enterprise-level readiness:
	•	Operational hardening
	•	Governance protection
	•	Regulatory alignment
	•	Court-admissible evidence structure
	•	Community oversight models
	•	Defence-in-depth auditing
	•	Progressive decentralisation plan

It is essential for projects scaling toward DAO governance, institutional participation, and long-term ecosystem integrity.
